    tos                 A subcommand for viewing, accepting, rejecting, and
                        otherwise interacting with a channel's Terms of
                        Service (ToS). This plugin periodically checks for
                        updated Terms of Service for the active/selected
                        channels. Channels with a Terms of Service will need
                        to be accepted or rejected prior to use. Conda will
                        only allow package installation from channels without
                        a Terms of Service or with an accepted Terms of
                        Service. Attempting to use a channel with a rejected
                        Terms of Service will result in an error.
    update (upgrade)    Update conda packages to the latest compatible
                        version.
